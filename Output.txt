thank you hi thank you for having me its great to be here paris is one of my favorite places in the world its actually on the first trip that i went out of south africa paris that was where i went when i was a little kid my parents brought me when i was like 6 years old ive loved paris ever since thank you for having me what im going to talk about today is just in general terms what is needed to address the climate crisis this is the thing that if we do what actions can we take that will accelerate the transition out of the fossil fuel era where we are today is  see if this is working or not all right we have the present era where we have the carbon cycle my apologies if some of you already know all about this but i think some of these things may be not as obvious as they may seem theres a certain amount of carbon that is circulating through the environment its going into the air and then getting absorbed by plants and animals and then going back into the air and this carbon is just circulating on the surface this is fine and its been doing that for hundreds of millions of yearsthe thing thats changed is that weve added something to the mix this is what i would call the turd in the punch bowl weve added all this extra carbon to the carbon cycle and the net result is that the carbon in the oceans atmosphere is growing over time its much more than can be absorbed by the ecosystem its really quite simple were taking billions of tons of carbon thats been buried for hundreds of millions of years and is not part of the carbon cycle taking from deep underground and adding it to the carbon cycle the result is that a steady increase in the carbon in the atmosphere and in the oceans which doesnt look like much if you look at it on this chart but when looked at in the context of history it actually looks like this so the carbon parts per million has really been bouncing around the 300 level for around 10 million years then the last few hundred years it went into a vertical climb this is the essence of the problem this is very unusual and a very very extreme threat as you can see from this rate of growth then this is accompanied by a temperature increase as one would expect this temperate increase people talk about 2 degrees or 3 degrees its important to appreciate just how sensitive the climate actually is to temperate its important to look at it in terms of absolute temperature not in degrees celsius relative to zero we need to say what is the temperature change relative to absolute zero thats how the universe thinks about temperature thats how physics thinks about temperature its relative to absolute zero for small changes result in huge effects new york city under ice would be minus 5 degrees new york city under water would be plus 5 degrees looked at as a percentage relative to absolute zero its only a plusminus 2 changethe sensitivity of climate is extremely extremely high weve amplified this sensitivity by building our cities right on the coastline and most people live very close to the ocean there are some countries of course that are very low lying and would be completely under water in a climate crisis weve essentially designed civilization to be super sensitive to climate change the important thing to appreciate is that we are going to exit the fossil fuels era it is inevitable that we will exit the fossil fuel era because at a certain point well simply run out of carbon to mine and burn the question is really when do we exit the era not if the goal is to exit the era as quickly as possible that means we need to move from the old goal with the preindustrial goal which was to move from chopping down forests and killing lots of whales the old goal was to move from chopping wood and killing whales to fossil fuels which actually in that context was a good thing but the new goal is to move to a sustainable energy future we want to use things like hydro solar wind geothermal nuclear is also a good option in places like france which arent subject to natural disasters we want to use energy sources that will be good for a billion years how do we accelerate this transition away from fossil fuels to a sustainable era and what happens if we dont if we wait and if we delay the change the best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy this is the best case if we dont take action now at the risk of being repetitive theres going to be no choice in the long term to move to sustainable energy its tautological we have to have sustainable energy or well simply run out of the other one the only thing we gain by slowing down the transition is just slowing it down it doesnt make it not occur it just slows it down the worst case however is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined these are the bestworst case scenarios then we have about 3 percent of scientists that believe in the best case about 97 percent that believe in the worst case this why i call it the dumbest experiment in history ever why would you do thisthe reason that transition is delayed or is happening slowly is because there is a hidden subsidy on all carbonproducing activity in a healthy market if you have say 10 euros of benefit and 4 euros of harm to society the profit would be 6 euros this makes obvious sense this is where the incentives are aligned with a good future this is not the case today if you have the incentives aligned then the forcing function towards a good future towards a sustainable energy future will be powerful in an unhealthy market you have your 10 euros of benefit if you have 4 euros but the 4 euros isnt taxed you have an untaxed negative externality this is basically economics 101 you have basically unreasonable profit and a forcing function to do carbonemitting activity because this cost to society is not being paid the net result is 35 gigatons of carbon per year into the atmosphere this is analogues to not paying for garbage collection its not as though we should say in the case of garbage have a garbagefree society its very difficult to have a garbagefree society but its just important that people pay for the garbage collection we need to go from having untaxed negative externality which is effectively a hidden carbon subsidy of enormous size 53 trillion a year according to the imf every year we need to move away from this and have a carbon tax this is being fought quite hard by the carbon producers theyre using tactics that are very similar to what the cigarette industry or the tobacco industry used for many years they would take the approach of even though the overwhelming signs of the consensus was that smoking cigarettes was bad for you they would find a few scientists that would disagree and then they would say look scientists disagree thats essentially how they would try to trick the public into thinking that smoking is not that bad the solution obviously is to remove the subsidy that means we need to have a carbon tax and to make it something which is neither a left nor a right issue we should make it probably a revenue neutral carbon tax this would be a case of increasing taxes on carbon but then reducing taxes in other places maybe there would be a reduction in sales tax or vat and an increase in carbon tax so that only those using high levels of carbon would pay an increased tax moreover in order to give industry time to react this could be a phasedin approach so that maybe it takes five years before the carbon taxes are very high so that means that only companies that dont take action today will suffer in five years there needs to be a clear message from government in this regard because the fundamental problem is the rules today incent people to create carbon and this is madness whatever you incent will happen thats why were seeing very little effect thus far depending upon what action we take will drive the carbon number to either extreme or moderate levels i think its pretty much a given that the 2degree c increase will occur the question is whether its going to be much more than that not if there will be a 2degree increase then the question is what can you do i would say whenever you have the opportunity talk to the politicians ask them to enact a carbon tax we have to fix the unpriced externality i would talk to your friends about it and fight the propaganda from the carbon industry thats the basic message i have and im happy to take questionssure there are many important issues in the world this is not the only important issue but it is i think the thing that will have the biggest negative effect on humanity if we do not address it based on the projections that were seeing right now these are like id say arguably best case projections were going to see significant rises in temperature and sea level the net result is if we dont take action we could see anywhere from 5 to 10 maybe more of the land mass absorbed by water which maybe doesnt like that much but about a third of humanity lives right on the coastline or in low lying countries wed be talking about maybe 2 billion people being displaced and their homes being destroyed and their countries being gone i think we should take action i think theres definitely a philanthropic element and i think in general people want to do the right thing and they want to do whats good the issue we have right now is that the rules fundamentally favor the bad outcome when youre fighting for the good outcome and its an uphill battle its just slower with respect to climate change its just critical that the government and the government is the setter of rules the governments decides what rules companies will play by and if we currently have a system which massively incents bad behavior even if most people dont do the bad behavior some people will still do the bad behavior yeah money and prices are basically just an information mechanism theyre just basically they tell you that  moneys mostly an information mechanism for labor allocation and tells companies what to do its just critical this is why its so critical that action be taken at a government level because the government is the one theyre setting the rules of the game its just crazy to have the rules of the game favor a bad outcome  im not aware of any carbon sequestration or carbon storage system that works and works economically i definitely wouldnt want to store the carbon in the ocean because of possible acidification as the co2 levels rise in the atmosphere some of that is absorbed into the ocean becomes carbonic acid a lot of the shellfish in particular are super sensitive to changes in ph level i would definitely err against  in the ocean though potentially you could try to store some of it in giant underground caverns but the sheer quantity were talking about i dont think can be stored anywhere theres just nowhere to store it yeah actually i think lithium in terms of energy storage lithium i think is definitely the future and will be for a long time theres actually not a shortage of lithium on earth lithium is number three on the periodic table its actually extremely common any salty water has lithium there definitely wont be a lithium constraint on energy storage for batteries i feel pretty confident that one could make enough batteries to store all the energy that the world needs with the current resources that are available yeah yeah we do actually weve got a number of very big storage projects underway with utilities around the world so both in the us and outside the thing thats interesting about the energy storage situation is that even without renewables theres a huge potential to make the energy grid more efficient and to be able to shut down the heaviest polluting power plants because the energy consumption through the day usually changes by a factor of two or more and since  with the exception of hydroelectric you cant store the power it has to be available in real time the world has somewhere between two to three times as many power plants as it actually needs if you can buffer the power with big stationary battery packs then you can actually shut down the worst half of the power plants in the world i think thats a very exciting thing that i think a lot of people dont appreciate and i think its going to make a big difference yeah absolutely i think this fundamentally is a government issue so as mentioned the government is the one that sets the rules of the game they set how companies are rewarded financially in the absence of government actually establishing some kind of a carbon tax or potentially a cap on trade on carbon which i was very excited to see that china announced earlier this year that they were going to do that unless the government does something to fix the market mechanism were fundamentally going to have a very slow transition out of the fossil fuel era its critical that government action change the incentive structure yeah id be very clear i think hopefully what comes out of the climate talks in paris is that the governments of the world they have to put their foot down and they say five years from now lets say there has to be a huge change and that companies know for sure that this is going to happen if they do then the investment decisions they make today will bear fruit in five years for heavy industrial applications or for heavy industry you know what the worlds going to look like in five years if you know what factories are being built today because if you build a really big factory to get to full production takes about five years from the start since we know 2600 that today there are very few sustainable energy projects at large scale that are being built we know that unless something changes very quickly sustainable energy will still be in a bad situation five years from now there are companies like at tesla and solar city were quite ideologically motivated but thats relatively unusual i think we should do both yeah yeah i think we  my personal ideology is split right now between trying to be helpful on earthrelated stuff which is sustainable energy and then trying to advance space technology so we can establish a selfsustaining city on mars i do think its important to be multiplanet not just one planet but another planet the overarching goal is to minimize existential risk if we look out into the future and say what are the things that pose a risk to humanity what is going to make the future good versus bad and i think obviously if we have a sustainable energy future thats good and the faster that comes the betterand then if were a multiplanet species that gives us much more resilience against an extinction event and also would be a really great and fun adventure sure the thing to appreciate about the installed industrial base is that its really enormous the number of petrol and diesel cars in the road and trucks is about 2 billion there are hundreds of thousands power plants using fossil fuels even if today we went super hard in the direction of renewables it would still take a long time i think before we see significant change its probably 10 or 20 years and theres a lot that can happen in 10 or 20 years of course the faster we can bring that date forward the better sure actually i should answer the nuclear question because that was posed just before this i actually think that nuclear fission if its in location that is not subject to natural disasters like in the case of france theres a very high percentage of nuclear i think thats actually a good thing obviously you dont want to have nuclear fission power plants in places that are subject to natural disasters because that obviously can go wrong i think fission is a good approachfusion is also interesting and its exciting to see whats happening with iter project which is a fusion plant thats being built in france i do think fusion is a feasible technology i think we can definitely make fusion work but it is a far off technology so to make fusion at the power plant level work is probably i dont know 30 years away and a lot of effort thats why at least for now and i think maybe even in the longterm im a proponent of using the big fusion power plant in the sky called the sun the sun is a giant fusion explosion and it shows up every day if we have photovoltaics solar panels we can capture that fusion energy it also needs to be stored in a battery so we can use it at night then we want to have high power lines to transfer solar energy from one place to another the important thing to appreciate is if lets say the only thing we had was solar energy that that was the only power source if you just took a small section of spain you could power all of europe its a very small amount of area thats actually needed to generate the electricity we need to power civilization or in the case of the us a little corner of nevada or utah power the entire united states i think if somebody wants to do something entrepreneurial in energy either you want to start a company or you want to join a company thats doing something sustainable and theres obviously wind solar and the geothermal theres tidal power i would just say look at companies that are trying to do sustainable energy and decide if you want to join them or if you want to start one starting companies in either the automotive arena or the energy arena is quite a tricky business when we first started tesla and solar city we thought they would fail tesla in particular we thought probably weve maybe 10 percent chance of success particularly cars its hard to stay alive as a car company honestly it must be one of the worst risk adjusted returns yeah its really what ive been saying here is that the governments of the world need to price the externality they need to put a proper price on carbon and then automatically the right behavior will occur by putting a price on carbon were essentially fixing a pricing error in the market system most of the times when governments intervene in markets its usually increases the pricing error when a pricing error is a huge tragedy or a commons issue like we have with carbon capacity its critical that the government put a price on it because you just cant go wrong by any price you put on it will be more right than close to zero which it is right now this is by far the most important thing if we want to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy there are other less effective ways by providing incentives and subsidies to say electric cars or solar that is sometimes a more politically expedient way to do it but the best way is just to directly fix the pricing error by taxing carbon this is if you ask most economists they would say the same thing this is well known obviously in the economics world yeah i definitely want to stay on the sustainable energy topic because its easier to get derailed on to many other things but yeah i just think we should cautious about the advent of ai and a lot of the people that i know that are developing ai are too convinced that the only outcomes is good  and we need to consider potentially less good outcomes and to be careful and really to monitor whats happening and make sure the public is aware of whats happening sure in the beginning of tesla and solar city i thought the probability of success was so low that i provided all of the money all of the money just came from me personally i didnt want to ask people other investors for money if i thought we were going to die because i thought we were i invested entirely the money that i got from paypal all of that got invested into tesla solar city and spacex even then we only narrowly survived so 2008 for tesla we actually closed the financing round on christmas eve 2008 it was the last hour of the last day that it was possiblethis is one of the tricky things with something like car companies there are good times and bad times and when the economy goes south then thats when things get really tricky for manufacturing company yeah in the us for example like the only two car companies that havent gone bankrupt in history are ford and tesla thats it everybody else is bankrupt or went bankrupt at some point general motors chrysler and others i think we just made it by the skin of our teeth these daysthe last few years its really id say the last two years is when teslas achieved a level where its not facing imminent death even as recently as early 2013 we were operating with maybe one to two weeks of money yeah i do think we should watch our consumption we shouldnt be wasteful but even if we are really conservative in our use of energy and are very effective with recycling and all sorts of things that delays the need to move to a sustainable future but it doesnt eliminate it if we dont have sustainable  energy generation theres no way that we can conserve our way to a good future we have to fundamentally make sustainable energy available on the plus side theres actually an enormous amount of sustainable energy the energy from the sun per square kilometer is a gigawatt if you just had a one kilometer by one kilometer array of solar panels it would be receiving a gigawatt of solar energy then at a 20 efficiency youd be generating 200 megawatts we can actually generate way more energy probably i dont know 100 times more energy than we actually need to operate civilization just with solar panels we just need to fix the incentive structure of the world to make sure that companies are incented towards sustainable versus unsustainable technology this is fundamentally the problem sure yeah i think each government they should do the right thing without depending upon what other governments are doing i think theres too much in these climate talks of countries trying to only do things if another country does it if its the right thing for the future a country should just do it and dont worry about what other countries are doing just do the right thing many of the countries are its really just we just want to encourage as many governments as possible to change the rules to incent a good future this is fundamentally what has to happen or we will substantially delay the transition away from carbon yeah thats what has to happen tesla and solar city my companies are very tiny were tiny tiny companies in order for there to be a big move towards sustainability the giant companies have to know that that is what the governments are demanding for the future and thats what the people are demanding for the future at the end of the day if the governments respond to popular pressure like if you tell politicians that your vote depends on them doing the right thing with climate change that makes a difference if theyre having a fund raising event or a dinner party or whatever and at every fund raising event in every dinner party somebodys asking them hey what are you doing about the climate then they will take action i think you have tremendous power you have the power to make a change let me tell you we definitely cant beat the oil and gas industry on lobbyists that would be a losing battle exxon makes more profit in a year than the value of the entire solar industry in the united states if you take every solar company in the united states its less than exxons profit in one year theres no way you can win on money thats impossible i dont have any real basis for this but i have a good feeling about it i do have a good feeling about it i think its going to be degrees of success like for example the copenhagen was terrible nothing came out of copenhagen climate talks it was basically i think there was a net increase in global warning as a result of that one unfortunately in the case of the paris talks i think there will be some positive movement and its a question of what degree i think we need to send a clear message to the negotiating teams and to the politicians that this time there needs to be a significant change this time something needs to happen  i think we just need to turn that argument around and say look this is a common good and if countries dont take action they all will share in a bad future everyone needs to take action and care about what the futures going to hold and lead by example even countries that are quite dependent on fossil fuels if they just change their tax structure they can move away from that in a way thats not super disruptive to the economy its really just a question of collecting the same amount of taxes but weighted towards things that people believe are most likely to be bad instead of things that are most likely to be goodwe do this already in our tax code we tax alcohol and cigarettes much more than we tax fruits and vegetables its just the sensible thing to do you dont hear countries saying we make lots of fruit and vegetables we want low taxeswe make lots of alcohol and tobacco and we want lower taxes thats a silly debate its gone i think the same thing applies to carbon emissions just adjust the tax code and the right thing will happen over time if its graduated over time and it starts off small and becomes significant in the future then even if youre heavily dependent on carbon today that message of seeing whats going to happen in the future will have a huge impact on the way that any given countrys economy works they will then become not dependent on carbon because of the incentive structure i really dont think they have anything to lose here anything to lose by taking action and a lot to lose by not taking action sure i expect all transport to go fully electric over time with the ironic exception of rockets then all energy production to go sustainable over time this will take a long time many decades but the way itll manifest itself is by people having batteries in their homes or at the utility substation and by driving electric vehicles and having electric planes as i said this is going to be a very slow transition because the incentive structure is so biased against sustainable energy in fact i think even if theres quite a strong action by government as a result of the climate talks in paris i think its still going to be a transition thats measured in decades itll be a slow transition and the fundamental question is how do we accelerate that transition thats the real question here what actions can we take that would accelerate a transition to a good future thats why im so harping on this notion of a revenue neutral carbon tax i think thats something that every country can implement and it could be graduated and phased in over time this will be by far the most effective thing for accelerating that transition to a good future yeah
